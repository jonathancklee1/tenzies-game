# Tenzies Dice Game with React

## About The Project

This is tenzies, a dice rolling table-top game typically played using 10 dice, inspired by the Scrimba's React Course. The project allowed me to hone my React skills using components and React hooks useState and useEffect. The basics features of the game were presented by the tutorial, however I took the extra step to add additional features to further enhance the game and to make it more interesting.

### Additional Features

- [X] Timer
